# About

**MeowMotion** is a Python package developed to process geolocation data from sources such as mobile phone apps. Its primary goal is to detect trips and identify transport modes using raw location data.

## ðŸ§ª Development and Funding

**MeowMotion** was developed by [Dr. Faraz Awan](https://www.farazawan.com) at the [Urban Big Data Centre (UBDC)](https://www.ubdc.ac.uk/), a research centre dedicated to advancing the use of data and technology to address urban challenges.

UBDC is jointly funded by the **Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)** and the **University of Glasgow**, under the following ESRC grants:

- [ES/L011921/1 â€“ Urban Big Data Centre](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=ES%2FL011921%2F1)
- [ES/S007105/1 â€“ Urban Big Data Centre](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=ES%2FS007105%2F1)

The centreâ€™s mission is to improve **social, economic, and environmental well-being** in cities by promoting the accessibility and responsible use of data.

The development of this package was supported as part of UBDC's broader goal to enable research and innovation through urban data science.
