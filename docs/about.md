# About

**MeowMotion** is a Python package developed to process geolocation data from sources such as mobile phone apps. Its primary goal is to detect trips and identify transport modes using raw location data.

## Development and Funding
This package was developed at the [Urban Big Data Centre (UBDC)](https://www.ubdc.ac.uk/). UBDC is jointly funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) and the University of Glasgow. The centre focuses on promoting the accessibility and use of data to tackle social inequalities, aiming to improve social, economic, and environmental well-being in cities. The development of MeowMotion was supported under this ESRC funding.
