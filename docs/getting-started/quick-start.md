## üìÇ Step 1: Prepare Your Data

Ensure you have a GPS data file (e.g., `sample_gps_data.csv`) with the following minimum columns:

| Column         | Description                      |
|----------------|----------------------------------|
| uid            | Unique identifier for each user  |
| datetime       | UTC timestamp of the GPS point   |
| lat            | Latitude                         |
| lng            | Longitude                        |
| impression_acc |  GPS point accuracy in meters    |

Example row:

```csv
uid,datetime,lat,lng,impression_acc
